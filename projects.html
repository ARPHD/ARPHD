          <h1>Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of manganese after a single intravenous infusion of mangafodipir in patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis.</h1>

          <div class="post">
          To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of manganese (Mn) after a 2-hour intravenous infusion of mangafodipir at 5 micromol/kg body weight and to correlate Mn concentrations with oxidative stress, early decrease in serum total bilirubin concentration, and prothrombin time (PT) in chronic alcoholic patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis. In 7 patients, a total of 49 serum Mn concentrations were determined on day 1 (before the start of the infusion and 15, 30, and 45 minutes after the end of the infusion) and on days 2, 7, 14, and 21. Fifty-seven PTs, reflecting liver activity, were measured on days 1, 2, 7, 14, and 21 and at months 1, 2, and 3. A population PK-pharmacodynamic model was developed to describe the kinetics of serum Mn concentrations and PT, to estimate interpatient variability, and to test covariate influence.

          <h1>Validation of body mass index for the diagnosis of malnutrition in patients with liver cirrhosis.</h1>

          <div class="post">
            Simple clinical tools are needed to detect malnutrition in cirrhotic patients. We have validated optimal body mass index (BMI) cut-offs for the diagnosis of malnutrition in accordance with the importance of ascites.
            BMI, mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) and triceps skinfold thickness (TST) were measured before paracentesis in study (SP) and validation (VP) populations of 875 and 294 cirrhotic patients, respectively with no ascite (NA), mild (MA), tense ascites (TA) (NA/MA/TA: SP: 327, 270, 278; VP: 111, 69, 114). Preserved nutritional status (SP: 259; VP: 93), malnutrition including severe and moderate malnutrition (SP: 251 and 365; VP: 92 and 109) were defined from MAMC and TST measurements.

          <h1>Combined polymorphisms of tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-10 genes in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.</h1>
          <p class="meta"><small>&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-calendar-o"></i> 2006</small></p><hr/>
          <div class="post">
            The development and progression of alcoholic hepatitis are controlled by an extensive cytokine network which involves pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Genetic variations determining production of these cytokines have been described and the susceptibility to the disease may be determined by an imbalance in the expression of several candidate genes.
            We have studied biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms at positions (-308) and (-238) in the promoter region of the pro-inflammatory tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and at positions (-1,082) and (-592) in the promoter of anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) in 134 patients with severe biopsy-proven alcoholic hepatitis and 145 healthy subjects.

        <h1>Enteral nutrition in severely malnourished and anorectic cirrhotic patients in clinical practice.</h1>
        <p class="meta"><small>&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-calendar-o"></i> 2005</small></p><hr/>
        <div class="post">
          To determine among severely malnourished cirrhotic patients remaining anorectic during hospital stay which patients may benefit from enteral nutrition in clinical practice.
          A prospective study including malnourished cirrhotic patients fed by enteral nutrition because of inadequate dietary intake after one-month hospitalization was carried out in a department receiving patients from other hospitals. Patients who died during hospital stay (N=35, group I) were compared to surviving patients (N=28, group II).
