  sumup: To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of manganese (Mn) after a 2-hour intravenous infusion of mangafodipir at 5 micromol/kg body weight and to correlate Mn concentrations with oxidative stress, early decrease in serum total bilirubin concentration, and prothrombin time (PT) in chronic alcoholic patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis. In 7 patients, a total of 49 serum Mn concentrations were determined on day 1 (before the start of the infusion and 15, 30, and 45 minutes after the end of the infusion) and on days 2, 7, 14, and 21. Fifty-seven PTs, reflecting liver activity, were measured on days 1, 2, 7, 14, and 21 and at months 1, 2, and 3. A population PK-pharmacodynamic model was developed to describe the kinetics of serum Mn concentrations and PT, to estimate interpatient variability, and to test covariate influence.
